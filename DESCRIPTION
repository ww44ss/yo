Package: yo
Title: Simplifies Debugging Chains of Piped Instructions
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Date: 2016-11-6
Author: Winston Saunders [aut, cre]

Description: This package defines an identity utility function ‘yo <- function(x) x’, a trivially idempotent operator useful for terminating long chains of piped instructions. In practice using this function greatly speeds up debugging of long piped-chains by allowing programmers to comment-out lines rather than modifying their structure.  This package is intended to be used in conjunction with ‘dplyr’, though does not formally depend on it.
Depends: R (>= 3.0.2)
Imports: dplyr (>= 0.3.0.1)
